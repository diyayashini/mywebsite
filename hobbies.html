      <p>
        Drawing is a form of visual art in which an artist uses instruments to
        mark paper or other two-dimensional surface. Drawing instruments include
        graphite pencils, pen and ink, various kinds of paints, inked brushes,
        colored pencils, crayons, charcoal, chalk, pastels, erasers, markers,
        styluses, and metals.

      <p>
        Writing is a cognitive and social activity involving neuropsychological
        and physical processes and the use of writing systems to create
        persistent representations of human language.
        Nevertheless, written language may take on characteristics distinctive
        from any available in spoken language.

      <p>
        Painting is the practice of applying paint, pigment, color or other
        medium to a solid surface. The medium is commonly applied to the base
        with a brush, but other implements, such as knives, sponges, and
        airbrushes, can be used. In art, the term "painting" describes both the
        act and the result of the action.

      <p>
        Reading is the process of looking at written symbols and letters and
        understanding the meaning of them. It's one of the four main language
        skills alongside listening, speaking and writing. Reading is usually the
        third language skill that you learn in your native language - it comes
        after listening and speaking.

      <p>
        Archery is a bow and arrow sport that uses a bow and arrow to shoot at a
        target. The target often consists of ten concentric circles, and points
        are awarded based on which circle the bow lands in. The word comes
        from the Latin arcus, meaning bow. Historically, archery has been used
        for hunting and combat. Now, it is mainly a competitive
        sport and recreational activity.

        Badminton is a racket sport played by either two opposing players
        (singles) or two opposing pairs (doubles), who take positions on
        opposite halves of a rectangular court that is divided by a net.
